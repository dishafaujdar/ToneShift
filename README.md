### Common Issues

**"Please configure your API key first"**
- Go to settings (gear icon) and enter a valid Anthropic API key
- Ensure the key starts with `sk-ant-` and is complete

**"Failed to transform text"**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify your API key is correct and has credits
- Try with shorter text (under 2000 characters)

**"Failed to replace text on page"**
- Some websites protect their content from modification
- Use the "Copy" button instead and paste manually
- The text will be copied to your clipboard automatically

**Floating button doesn't appear**
- Make sure you've selected text (highlighted)
- Try refreshing the page
- Check if the website allows content scripts

- Clear history periodically to free up storage
